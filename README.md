## Javascript App Template

This template is a framework agnostic template to creating new application for javascript webapps.
It is intended to be customized and specialized for different frontend webapps.
However, it is primarily designed for single page javascript apps.
Whether it be [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/), or any other front end framework, this template should work for you.
This template will bootstrap an application with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management, [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/) for bundle management, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for javascript compiling, and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for asset serving.

### Usage

**To install new packages to use NPM**
```
 $ npm install --save lodash
```

**To start a local webserver**
```
 $ npm run start
```
